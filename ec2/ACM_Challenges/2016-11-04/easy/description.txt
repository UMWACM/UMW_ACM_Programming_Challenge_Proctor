How many do I have?        Easy - d9615f         ACM BiWeekly Chal. Oct 21-Oct 31


Halloween time is upon us, and with it children going door to door accumulating bags of candy. There is but one problem: how much candy is there?


Write a program which takes in a single line of input. The input will be a comma-separated list of candies in a bag (eg “Tootsie Roll, Snickers, Mars Bar”). Your program must count the number of candies and print out the total number. Duplicated names of candies are treated as separate pieces of candies (“Gum, Gum” would be 2 pieces of candy).
